# ❌ Flutter Error: PathExistsException when copying asset files

# 🧠 What's Going On?
While building my Flutter app, I encountered the following error:

Target debug_android_application failed: 
PathExistsException: Cannot copy file to '...\flutter_assets\assets\background.jpg' 
(OS Error: Cannot create a file when that file already exists., errno = 183)

# 🔍 Root Cause
Flutter attempts to copy an asset file (like background.jpg) into the flutter_assets build directory.
But Windows blocks the process because the file already exists in that location.
Unlike Unix-based systems, Windows sometimes prevents overwriting files—causing the build to crash.

# 🛠️ The Quick Fix
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run

✅ This clears the build cache and lets Flutter rebuild the project from scratch. That usually solves the issue instantly.

# 📌 What Caused It?
- I replaced an image file but kept the same filename (background.jpg).
- Flutter tried to overwrite the old file during build.
- Windows refused the overwrite due to file locking or caching.

# 💡 How to Avoid It in the Future
✅ Use unique filenames when replacing images.

✅ Avoid duplicate asset paths in pubspec.yaml.

# ✅ Correct:
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/background.jpg

# ❌ Wrong (Duplicated):
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/background.jpg

✅ Stick to lowercase filenames (Windows is case-insensitive).

✅ Exclude build/cache folders in .gitignore:

/build
/.dart_tool
/.idea

# ✨ Lesson Learned
Keep your asset structure clean and avoid silent overwrites.
What seems like a small image update can crash your entire build—especially when working on Windows.
