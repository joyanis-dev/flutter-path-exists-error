# ❌ Flutter Error: PathExistsException when copying asset files

## 🔍 The Problem

While building my Flutter app, I kept running into this error:

Target debug_android_application failed: PathExistsException: Cannot copy file to '...\flutter_assets\assets\background.jpg'
(OS Error: Cannot create a file when that file already exists., errno = 183)

yaml

### 💥 Translation?

Flutter tries to copy your image file (like `background.jpg`) from your `assets/` folder into the build directory.  
But Windows says: **"Nope, there's already a file with that name here. I’m not replacing it!"**  
So the build crashes.

## 🛠️ The Quick Fix


flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run

This wipes the build cache and lets Flutter start fresh. Usually solves it right away.

📌 Why this happens
You might’ve changed an image file but kept the same name (e.g., replaced background.jpg but didn’t rename it).

Flutter's build system gets confused and tries to copy over an already-existing file.

Windows doesn’t like overwriting some files under certain conditions.

🧼 The Clean Setup
Make sure your assets are listed only once in pubspec.yaml:

yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/background.jpg
Don't do things like:

yaml


flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/background.jpg  # ❌ Duplicate
    
💡 Pro Tips to Avoid It Again
💾 Give image files unique names when replacing them.

🔠 Stick to lowercase file names (Windows is case-insensitive).

🧹 Use .gitignore to exclude these folders:

bash


/build
/.dart_tool
/.idea
🧠 Be careful not to accidentally commit cached flutter_assets/ stuff.
